class Relation(object):
    """A class that expresses a relation from one concept to another.
    
    Relations are directional, having both a `source` and a `target`. They also
    have a `relation_type`, used to describe the nature of the association
    between the related concepts.

    Relations are added to the `Concept.relations` and `Concept.referrers`
    properties automatically, as soon as they are instantiated. All the
    properties of this class are read only.

    Certain types of relations have a complementary relation type, which will
    be used to establish a second relation pointing back to the source concept.
    For example, the following code::

        twin_peaks = Concept("Twin Peaks")
        david_lynch = Concept("David Lynch")
        Relation(twin_peaks, "created_by", david_lynch)

    Produces exactly the same effect as the following snippet::

        twin_peaks = Concept("Twin Peaks")
        david_lynch = Concept("David Lynch")
        Relation(david_lynch, "creator_of", twin_peaks)

    Because the **created_by** and **creator_of** relation types are
    complementary, declaring one end of the relation implicitly declares its
    complementary version.

                artistic creation, product, invention or any other kind of
                development that has been realized by the source concept.

            contained_by: 
                Indicates that the source concept is a part, example or
                specialization of the target concept. This is used to form
                topic hierarchies. For example, "Music" > "Classical Music" >
                "Beethoven's 9th Symphony".

            contains:
                Complements the **contained_by** relation type. Indicates

                the target concept is a part of.
